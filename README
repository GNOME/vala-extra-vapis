This repository provides Vala bindings to various libraries which do
not provide their own bindings, and for which valac does not provide
bindings.

== Rationale ==

In most cases it is preferable for libraries to ship their own
bindings (some of the reasons why, as well as information on how to do
so, are at http://live.gnome.org/Vala/UpstreamGuide).  Some libraries,
however, are unable or unwilling to do so.  Other bindings are
distributed with valac, but generally that is reserved for relatively
popular libraries with well structured VAPIs and have a fairly strong
aversion to breaking backwards compatibility.

The purpose of this repository is provide a stable home for bindings
which would otherwise not have one.  Unlike valac, where submissions
are screened with care before inclusion, the barrier to entry for this
repository is quite low.  Pretty much the only thing which would
preclude inclusion is a licensing issue.  You don't need to commit to
maintaining the bindings, preserving backwards compatibility, testing,
etc.

== Usage ==

Because the bindings shipped in this repository provide no
backwards-compatibility promises, it is designed to be used as a git
submodule.  If that is not acceptable (for example, if you don't use
git), it is recommended you simply copy the bindings you need into
your source tree.

== Submitting Bindings For Inclusion ==

If you have bindings which you would like to see housed in this
repository, simply submit a request.
